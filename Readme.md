# Silly Votes (Azure)

A variation of the main Silly Votes project, mainly to try and have the same idea but using services offered in Azure.

The goal is to try and utilize B2C, CosmosDB and eventually Azure functions.

## Current Status

Regretibly, this side project is on hold.  In trying to get my docker images up and running, I encountered an issue trying to expose one of the resulting containers with HTTPS.

To add to my own personal embarrasment, the main cloud technology in my area is actually AWS.

This project is not forgotten, but it is resting and some of its ideas will be brought in to the main Silly Votes repository.
